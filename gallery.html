            <h2>Bangui Windmill</h2>
            <p>The Northwind Bangui Bay Project is located in the municipality of Bangui, Ilocos Norte, Philippines, at the north-west tip of Luzon island. The turbines face the sea from where the prevailing wind blows towards the land. Its location along the shore is optimal, due to a lack of windbreaks and limited terrain roughness. The site consists of 20 Vestas Wind Systems stretching 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) over the shoreline of the bay.</p>

              <h2>Kapurpurawan Rock Information</h2>
              <p>Standing beautifully in the coast of the town of Burgos, fronting the roaring waves of Bangui Bay, Kapurpurawan Rock Formation was formed thousands (or even millions) of years ago by accumulation of particles deposited to the shore by the forces of sea waves and wind, with the aid of gravity and time. It is a very long process known in science as sedimentation.</p>
